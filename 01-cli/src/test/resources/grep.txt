0 On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
1 demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee
2 the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their
3 duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.
4 These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice
5 is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is
6 to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty
7 or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and
8 annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of
9 selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to
10 avoid worse pains
